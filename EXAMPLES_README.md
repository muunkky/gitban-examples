# Gitban Example Cards

> Canonical example cards demonstrating gitban best practices across all card types and complexity levels

This repository contains high-quality example cards that demonstrate how to write effective gitban cards for different scenarios. Use these as learning materials, starting points for your own cards, or templates to adapt.

## üìö What's Inside

**12 Example Cards** covering all major card types:
- üéØ **Features** (simple, medium, complex) - New functionality and capabilities
- üêõ **Bugs** (simple, medium) - Issues and defects with reproduction steps
- üìñ **Docs** - Documentation tasks and technical writing
- ‚úÖ **Tests** - Test coverage and quality improvements
- üîß **Chore** - Maintenance, dependencies, tooling
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Refactor** - Code quality and architecture improvements
- üíÖ **Style** - Code formatting and style consistency
- ‚ö° **Performance** - Optimization and speed improvements
- ü§ñ **CI** - Continuous integration and deployment

## üöÄ Using These Examples

### Via Gitban MCP Tools

The easiest way to explore and use these examples is through gitban's MCP tools:

```python
# List all available examples
list_example_cards()

# Filter by card type
list_example_cards(card_type="feature")

# Filter by complexity
list_example_cards(complexity="simple")

# Filter by tags
list_example_cards(tags=["beginner-friendly"])

# Download a specific example
download_example_card("feature-simple-button")

# Download to custom location
download_example_card("bug-simple-crash", save_to="my-examples/bug-template.md")
```

### Manual Download

You can also browse and download examples directly from this repository:

1. Browse the `examples/` directory
2. Click on any `.md` file to view
3. Click "Raw" to download
4. Save to your `.gitban/examples/` directory

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** These example files use descriptive names like `feature-simple-button.md` for readability. If you want to use them as actual gitban cards in your workspace, you'll need to rename them to follow gitban's card naming convention:

```
# Example filename (for learning):
feature-simple-button.md

# Actual card filename (for use in .gitban/cards/):
backlog-P1-feature-add-submit-button-abc123.md
```

The MCP tool `download_example_card()` handles this automatically when you save to `.gitban/cards/`, but manual downloads will need renaming.

## üìã Example Index
